To compensate, we cache measured values so that\n * we can avoid re-measuring during operations that should not alter heights, like scrolling.\n *\n * To optimize glass rendering performance, onShouldVirtualize can be set. When onShouldVirtualize return false,\n * List will run in fast mode (not virtualized) to render all items without any measurements to improve page load time. And we\n * start doing measurements and rendering in virtualized mode when items grows larger than this threshold.\n *\n * However, certain operations can make measure data stale. For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,\n * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow. When these operations occur, we increment a measureVersion\n * number, which we associate with cached measurements and use to determine if a remeasure should occur.\n */\nexport class List extends BaseComponent<IListProps, IListState> implements IList {\n  public static defaultProps = {\n    startIndex: 0,\n    onRenderCell: (item: any, index: number, containsFocus: boolean) => (<div>{ (item && item.name) || '' }</div>),\n    renderedWindowsAhead: DEFAULT_RENDERED_WINDOWS_AHEAD,\n    renderedWindowsBehind: DEFAULT_RENDERED_WINDOWS_BEHIND\n  };\n\n  public refs: {\n    [key: string]: React.ReactInstance,\n    root: HTMLElement,\n    surface: HTMLElement\n  };\n\n  private _estimatedPageHeight: number;\n  private _totalEstimates: number;\n  private _cachedPageHeights: {\n    [key: string]: {\n      height: number,\n      measureVersion: number\n    }\n  };\n  private _focusedIndex: number;\n  private _scrollElement: HTMLElement;\n  private _scrollingToIndex: number;\n  private _hasCompletedFirstRender: boolean;\n\n  // surface rect relative to window\n  private _surfaceRect: IRectangle;\n\n  // The visible rect that we're required to render given the current list state.\n  private _requiredRect: IRectangle | null;\n\n  // The visible rect that we're allowed to keep rendered.
